    <p>This page shortens URLs, provides short aliases for redirection of long URLs as well as custom aliases for such
        URLs. The code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/luisgarciaalanis/MiniURL">GitHub page</a>.</p>

    <h4><strong>Technologies used for the app backend:</strong></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Node with Hapi.js web framework.</li>
        <li>MongoDB (the reason for using a NOSQL database was because it's suppose
            to be lightning fast when used with non relational data and it also works with cloud providers like AZURE
            and AWS).</li>
        <li>App written in Ecmascript 6 (ES6 - Javascript 2015) except a few files shared with the frontend.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4><strong>Technologies used for the app frontend:</strong></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>AngularJS as a single page application.</li>
        <li>Angular ui router</li>
        <li>Twitter Bootstrap for styling.</li>
        <li>App written in vanilla ES5 javascript.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4><strong>Technologies used for deployment:</strong></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Docker for easy deployment to production.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4><strong>Technologies I use for continuous integration:</strong></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Jenkins</li>
        <li>Dockerhub repository</li>
    </ol>
    <h4><strong>Technologies I use for unit testing:</strong></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mocha</li>
        <li>Selenium web driver (Some basic tests and not integrated with Jenkins).</li>

    <h4><strong>How it works:</strong></h4>
    <br>
    <h5><strong>Data storage:</strong></h5>
    <p>Data is stored into one of two collections, one for the custom aliased URLs and the other one for the automatic
        generated URLs. The reason behind this decision was because more than one custom alias could potentially point
        to the same URL; In order for MongoDB to be speedy while handling millions of entries it needs to have indexes of
        unique data, so I kept the auto generated aliases on its on data collection, so if more than one person enters a
        URL it can return the same alias <strong>just like TinyURL.com works</strong>. When submitting a custom alias we
        never return the same URL if its already there, we don't care we just generate a new entry on the collection.
    </p>
    <p>One of the big problems is finding a way to generate the aliases in a unique way. This resulted problematic since
        I could not find a way to do this without the possibility of alias collisions. This is why the application
        seeds the database with random generated aliases with no URLs. It then goes and uses them as URLs are entered.
        The cost of this design is space pre allocated on the database, I think this approach is better than generating
        random aliases on the fly with the possibility of collissions. The amount of auto generated seeds can be
        configured. Once the app runs out of them it insets the next batch.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example if the app is configured to generate one million aliases it will generate a list of sequential
        ordered integers, it will then randomize the list with an N log N algorithm. It will convert each number into
        a string based on the aliases allowed characters and it will bulk insert it into the database.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bulk inserting into the database is done in chunks of 1000 since its the default standard form mongo bulk
        operations. Also it does this in a times controlled async wait to avoid blocking the app and allowing the app to
        keep operating as soon as the first inserts are done. It also tracks how many elements have been inserted into
        the database so that the next time the app needs to seed it nows from where to start the alias creation.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5><strong>Aliases:</strong></h5>
    <p>
        Aliases are generated from a subset of numbers and letters in lower case, avoiding some that could cause
        confusion to the user. For example a '0' could be confused with an 'O', and 'l' could be confused with an 'I' or
        even the number '1' depending on the font being used.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Alias valid characters (a modified set of Base32 encoding): </strong>abcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz2345679</p>
    <br>
    <h4><strong>Wish list/ missing:</strong></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>More work on the parser to be smarter and more <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986">rfc3986</a>
        compliant. Including IpV6 native Addresses....</li>
        <li>More work on the parser to return an object instead of true, the object containing the parts of the URL.
        The idea is to be more robust to prevent self injection circular denial of service attack.</li>
        <li>More tests, and more UI tests.</li>
    </ol>
